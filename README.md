# Nearmap Text Based Coverage Check

Simple HTML and javascript site leveraging Nearmap Coverage API and Mapbox Geoloation API to enable a text based approach for simple coverage reports by Nearmap. This requires an API key for both Nearmap and Mapbox to use, hope to deploy this to an internal web app.
